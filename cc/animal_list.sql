Asian elephants have gray skin that is covered with hair. In adults, this hair is sparse, while calves have thicker brown hair. The body length ranges from 550 to 640 cm. The trunk is a distinctive feature of the elephant family (Elephantidae). There is a large degree of sexual dimorphism in elephants. The males are much larger than the females. Males have a height of 240 to 300 cm with a body mass of 3,500 to 6,000 kg. Females are 195 to 240 cm in height with a body mass of 2,000 to 3,500 kg. Males have tusks which are an elongation of the second upper incisors, while females lack tusks. (Daniel, 1998; Kurt and Garai, 2007; Nowak, 1999; Sukumar, 2003; Sukumar, 2006)\n\nThere are several differences between Asian elephants (genus Elephas) and African elephants (genus Loxodonta), which is the only other genus of elephants still alive. Elephas maximus has a smaller size compared to Loxodonta. Asian elephants have one fingerlike projection at the tip of the trunk, differing from African elephants (Loxodonta), which have two fingerlike projections. Elephas maximus has large flat ears, but they are smaller than the ears of Loxodonta. Asian elephants have four hooves on the hind foot while African elephants have only three hooves. Elephas maximus has a flat back while Loxodonta have a sloping back. As a result, the head is the highest part of the body in E. maximus, while the shoulders are the highest in Loxodonta. Only male Asian elephants bear tusks while both male and female African elephants have tusks. (Nowak, 1999; Sukumar, 2003)\n\nThere are three subspecies recognized: Elephas maximus maximus in Sri Lanka, Elephas maximus indicus in the Asian mainland, and Elephas maximus sumatranus in Sumatra (Indonesia). Elephas maximus maximus is different from the other subspecies because 90 to 95 percent of males lack tusks. There are varying views regarding which groups should be considered different subspecies. Based on DNA analyses, E. m. maximus and E. m. indicus may be part of the same group, while the population of Elephas maximus in Borneo may be a distinct subspecies.

As they age, the eggs become light brown. The appearance of common mormon eggs is similar to the eggs of common lime butterflies, to the point that distinguishing the eggs of these two species is difficult. However, common lime butterflies lay their eggs on the axial part of the leaf, the stems, or on the thorns, while common mormons do not.\n\nAs a first-instar caterpillar, P. polytes has a distinctive head characterized by conspicuous sutures (shallow grooves), primary setae (large, spiky projections), and hypognathous mandibles (the lower mandible is longer than the upper mandible). Its body is light brown with white splotches, causing the caterpillar to resemble bird droppings (which serves as good camouflage). On the prothorax is an osmeterium, which is a forked, fleshy organ that emerges from the anterior of the caterpillar when it is threatened and secretes noxious chemicals to ward off predators. The caterpillar grows bigger but looks similar as it progresses through the fourth instar. In its fifth instar, the larva becomes light green, and a broad, raised stripe appears near its head.\n\nThe pupa of P. polytes is either light green, with two yellow-green patches on either side of the pupal case, or light brown.\n\nAdult common mormon butterflies have a wingspan of 70 to 115 mm. Their hindwings have swallowtails. Adult males are smaller than females. All common mormon males look the same, with black wings that are dotted with a row of white spots across the hindwings and on the margins of the forewings. The upper forewing also has a row of white spots, which get smaller toward the wing tip. Common mormons occasionally have red crescents on the margins of each wing.\n\nAdult females have several polymorphisms, most of which mimic other butterfly species that are unpalatable. The cyrus form is non-mimetic. It is very similar in appearance to males but has paler coloration and more distinct red crescents. The cyrus form is found across the common mormon\'s entire range. The most common is the stichius form, which mimics Pachliopta aristolochiae (common rose butterfly) and is found in common mormon populations from the Himalayas to Japan, Sulawesi, and Sri Lanka. The theseus form mimics the common rose butterfly\'s black form and is found where the habitat of both butterflies overlaps in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The romulus form mimics Pachliopta hector (crimson rose butterfly) but is duller in color. These mimetic polymorphisms, which effectively disguise the common mormon butterfly as other, toxic butterfly species, enable common mormon females to avoid being eaten by predators. Because P. polytes is palatable and mimics unpalatable butterfly species, this predator evasion strategy is an example of Batesian mimicry.

There are over 100 breeds of domestic cats but all have a very similar body shape and size. Adult mass ranges from 4.1 to 5.4 kg, and average length is 76.2 cm. Interbreed variation is defined based on coat type and coloration or patterning of the fur. Domestic cat have approximately 244 bones in their body, of which about 30 are vertebrae (the number can vary depending upon the length of cat). With so many vertebrae in their spine, cats are very flexible and can rotate half of their spine 180Â°. They are capable of jumping five times their own height and are able to slip through narrow spaces because they have no collar bone and their scapulae lie medially on their body. Each forelimb (i.e., manus) has five digits and the hindlimbs (i.e., pes) have four. Polydactyly is not uncommon among house cats. They have retractable claws on each paw, which typically do not extend when the animal walks. They have 26 teeth that usually develop within the first year. The dental formula for this species is 3/3, 1/1, 2/2, 1/1. When kittens are about two weeks old they develop deciduous or milk teeth above the gums. By the end of the fourth month the milk incisors are replaced by permanent teeth. (Davison, 1947; Edwards, 2009; Wilkins, 2007)', NULL),

The horns of a female are much smaller and only slightly curved. The horns of a ram can tell much about him such as his age, health, and fighting history. The desert subspecies, Ovis canadensis nelsoni, is somewhat smaller and has flatter, wider-spreading horns. The pelage of Ovis canadensis is smooth and composed of an outer coat of brittle guard hairs and short, grey, crimped fleece underfur.
